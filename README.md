## Introduction

Climate change is one of the most significant challenges of our era, and yet many students lack the tools to fully understand how their everyday decisions impact the environment. **Earth in Your Hands** aims to bridge this knowledge gap by offering an engaging educational experience where players simulate managing a country‚Äôs environmental policies. Using real-world data, players make decisions that affect greenhouse gas emissions and witness the consequences of their actions on global climate phenomena like global warming and sea levels.
